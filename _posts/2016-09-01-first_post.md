Hello, I am Daniel Sank.
Until now, I've avoided writing a public journal<sup>1</sup> because I generally think it makes more sense to organize information by topic rather than by author.
For example, I'm usually more interested in Stack Overflow posts regarding a particular code pattern as opposed to posts written by turb0c0der733t.
I put my detailed math and physics notes in a [github repo](https://github.com/DanielSank/theory), and more Q&A style writeups on [Physics Stack Exchange](http://physics.stackexchange.com/users/31790/danielsank?tab=profile).
However, occasionally I suppose a person has something useful or interesting to write down which doesn't quite fit into one of those formal settings, or which is of a more personal nature and so *should* be organized by author.
Well, at least I feel that way some times, so I figured I'd write a public journal.
Also, Bernardo told me to do it.

## What is this?
I think this journal will be mostly a set of notes introducing topics more completely developed elsewhere.
For example, I might give an intuitive discussion of the signal to noise ratio in an IQ demodulator, and then link to a [more complete discussion](http://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/24372/what-is-the-connection-between-analog-signal-to-noise-ratio-and-signal-to-noise/24373).
I'd also like to use this journal to discuss topics less suited to formal writing, such as opinions about movies and books, minor one-off projects, and discussions about longer term projects that simply haven't solidified enough to be written down more carefully elsewhere.
There will also be octopuses.

## What's with the name?
I'm a physicist and I like octopuses (a lot. Well I like physics a lot too. I like physics and octopuses a lot).
The [Eightfold Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_Way_(physics)) is a term given to an amazing geometrical way of categorizing subatomic particles.<sup>2</sup>
Also octopuses have eight arms.
And I just like the name.

`[1]:` "Blog" is a terrible ugly word.

`[2]:` The term's use in physics is derived from the [Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path) notion in Buddhism.
