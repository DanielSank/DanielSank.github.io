# Introduction

* Line of beans

* Number of ways of being, given a description

* Vocabulary
  * Description = constraint
  * Ways of being = microstates

# Definition

* Linear in number of system constituents

* Concatenating systems: add entropy


# Random walk

Random walk (chain of spins).
Show number of walks which wind up in center is very large.
Strongly peaked.
Similarly, magnetization centered near zero, very sharp.
Macroscopic variable: highly degenerate function of microstate.

# Statistical mechanics

* Previous item more or less proves second law, but you have to understand what it means.
"Entropy maximized" means the macroscopic variable is such that the degeneracy is as large as  possible, i.e. most microstates.

# Temperature

* Systems in contact

* Lagrange multiplier
