## Super Metroid

Super Metroid is my favorite game ever.

* Immersive
  * Labyrinth
  * No speaking characters
  * You, your map, and these compelling items
  * Uninvasive, all encompassing sound
* Layout teaches you how to play
  * Obstacles just sit there, impassable, until you come back with the right equipment. This defined an entire genre.
  * Watching animals in the planet teaches you how to do new stuff that you could *already* do. This makes you rethink the entire game. Despite this, the game is not broken.
* The entire game is an integrated training field.
  * Once you win, you find out
    * How many items you got
    * How long you took
  * So you want to go back and get more stuff and do it faster. You know you *didn't see the whole game*.
  * And you have these new techniques! You can use them earlier in the game than where you learned them.
  * The real game becomes trying to get all the stuff as quickly and cleverly as possible.
* And then you learn that some items you thought were necessary are not.
* Speed run culture.
* AGDQ $10k toward saving animals.

Nothing extraneous.
[Fantastic music]()
Open route, and apprently essential items can be skipped with clever navigation and tricks.
Result the item skipping and free routing is unparalleled replay value.

If you somehow manage to play the game enough to get bored of the map, there's an [incredibly professional fan remake]().
