I've been wanting to write a post describing a few of my favorite video games and why I like them.
Why?
Well, video games are a cross between a game, a work of art, and in some cases a full-on competative sport with fans and sponors.
We gravitate toward and remember video games for their music, their visual styles, and in many cases for their narratives, so I think discussing ones favorite video games is similar to discussing ones favorite musical compositions or books.
Also, they're fun.
Also, I want to put out an open challenge to anyone who might think they can beat me in Smash Brothers Melee (hint: you can't, unless you're Jason in which case you should come over so I can try to win my money back).

## Super Metroid

If I had to pick a single favorite video game, it would be *Super Metroid*.

### Prologue: the first minute

The game begins with the protagonist, Samus Aran, exposing the backstory via text monologue.
Samus summarizes the plot of the previous two Metroid games: in the first, she foiled the plot of Mother Brain to use Metroids, an energy producing life form, to attack civilization, and in the second went to the Metroid home world SR388 to erradicate every single one of them.

I love this prologue because so much aesthetic style is established so quickly, while unwaveringly developing the plot and characters.
In just one minute, the prologue establishes Samus as a capable, incredibly ruthless hunter who nevertheless has merciful instincts toward a baby creature.
The efficiency and ruthlessness comes out in her narratation of the genocide she enacted on SR388, delivered to us through green text, clicked out onto the screen at a robotically even tempo, on top of a shadowed portrait of Samus, her face half shrouded behind her helmet.
Then, immediately following, Samus's hesitation to kill the larva comes to us in a cutscene.
Here, *Super Metroid* begins to show its genius: the cutscene showing Samus point her cannon at the larva, hesitate, and ultimatly allow the larva to follow her, is moving in the context of her mission of total genocide.
The narrative of the scene is already enough to hold it up, but the aesthetics are what make the scene and the rest of *Super Metroid* great.
The cutscene is rendered with similar graphics as the game, *Metroid II*, in which it happened.
Particularly for players who have played *Metroid II*, this giving it a feeling of authenticity, i.e. you remember that *"this really happened"*.

In fact, there's another cutscene showing Samus destroy Mother Brain too, so by the end of that first minute of the proloue, we've seen "archival footage" of the two key points in Samus's history establishing the two most important aspects of her personality, we've seen some gameplay footage, and all with some of the best game music ever.

No spoilers here, as this is the very beginning of the game.

### 
* Immersive
  * Labyrinth
  * No speaking characters
  * You, your map, and these compelling items
  * Uninvasive, all encompassing sound
* Layout teaches you how to play
  * Obstacles just sit there, impassable, until you come back with the right equipment. This defined an entire genre.
  * Watching animals in the planet teaches you how to do new stuff that you could *already* do. This makes you rethink the entire game. Despite this, the game is not broken.
* The entire game is an integrated training field.
  * Once you win, you find out
    * How many items you got
    * How long you took
  * So you want to go back and get more stuff and do it faster. You know you *didn't see the whole game*.
  * And you have these new techniques! You can use them earlier in the game than where you learned them.
  * The real game becomes trying to get all the stuff as quickly and cleverly as possible.
* And then you learn that some items you thought were necessary are not.
* Speed run culture.
* AGDQ $10k toward saving animals.

Nothing extraneous.
[Fantastic music]()
Open route, and apprently essential items can be skipped with clever navigation and tricks.
Result the item skipping and free routing is unparalleled replay value.

If you somehow manage to play the game enough to get bored of the map, there's an [incredibly professional fan remake]().

Mention Metroid Prime series.


It's not just me; *Super Metroid* is near the top of all the best video games lists.
For example, it's tied for eigth place on the [Wikipedia list of games in the most "best of" lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best) along side the iconic *Super Mario World* and *Half Life 2*.
That being the case, *Super Metroid* has been the subject of many articles examining and glorifying its gameplay, world design, visual style, and, consistently, its sound.
