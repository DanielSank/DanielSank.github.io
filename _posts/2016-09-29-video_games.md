## Super Metroid

Super Metroid is my favorite game ever.
Nothing extraneous.
[Fantastic music]()
Open route, and apprently essential items can be skipped with clever navigation and tricks.
Result the item skipping and free routing is unparalleled replay value.

If you somehow manage to play the game enough to get bored of the map, there's an [incredibly professional fan remake]().


## Ninja Gaiden 2

Cutscenes.
Music.


## Super Smash Brothers Melee

Best multiplayer game in the world.
This game is so good that fifteen years after it's 2001 release, it's still the subject of tournaments that bring in thousands of competitors.with winnings in the tens of thousands.


## Rogue Squadron 2

Single player space shooter.
