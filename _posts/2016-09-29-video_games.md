In this post, I describe a few of my favorite video games and why I like them.
Why?
Well, video games are a cross between a game, a work of art, and in some cases even a sport.
We gravitate toward and remember video games for their music, their visual styles, and in many cases for their narratives, so I think discussing ones favorite video games is similar to discussing ones favorite musical compositions etc.
Also, they're fun.


## Super Metroid

Super Metroid is my favorite game.


* Immersive
  * Labyrinth
  * No speaking characters
  * You, your map, and these compelling items
  * Uninvasive, all encompassing sound
* Layout teaches you how to play
  * Obstacles just sit there, impassable, until you come back with the right equipment. This defined an entire genre.
  * Watching animals in the planet teaches you how to do new stuff that you could *already* do. This makes you rethink the entire game. Despite this, the game is not broken.
* The entire game is an integrated training field.
  * Once you win, you find out
    * How many items you got
    * How long you took
  * So you want to go back and get more stuff and do it faster. You know you *didn't see the whole game*.
  * And you have these new techniques! You can use them earlier in the game than where you learned them.
  * The real game becomes trying to get all the stuff as quickly and cleverly as possible.
* And then you learn that some items you thought were necessary are not.
* Speed run culture.
* AGDQ $10k toward saving animals.

Nothing extraneous.
[Fantastic music]()
Open route, and apprently essential items can be skipped with clever navigation and tricks.
Result the item skipping and free routing is unparalleled replay value.

If you somehow manage to play the game enough to get bored of the map, there's an [incredibly professional fan remake]().


## Ninja Gaiden 2

Cutscenes.
Music.


## Super Smash Brothers Melee

Best multiplayer game in the world.
This game is so good that fifteen years after it's 2001 release, it's still the subject of tournaments that bring in thousands of competitors.with winnings in the tens of thousands.


## Rogue Squadron 2

Single player space shooter.
